            Talankey was built on a belief: that precision manufacturing can
            help industries build faster, better, and smarter. What began as a
            small, focused team in Bangalore has grown into a trusted partner
            for CNC machining, 3D printing, fabrication, and more.
            <br /> Over time, we’ve served clients across automotive, aerospace,
            EV, railways, and medical sectors—delivering components that meet
            high standards and real-world demands.
            <br /> Our mission is to deliver quality-driven manufacturing with
            accuracy and efficiency. Our vision is to be a dependable partner
            for businesses that value precision, innovation, and long-term
            collaboration.
            <br /> At Talankey, we’re not just making parts. We’re helping ideas
            come to life. With skilled people, advanced machines, and a
            commitment to every detail, we turn concepts into reliable
            solutions.
            <br /> Because to us, manufacturing is about more than just output.
            It’s about building trust, enabling progress, and shaping what comes
            next.
